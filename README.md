This repository contains code for fine-tuning SDXL using DreamBooth and LoRA, along with inference code. It also contains code for running inception score and FID metrics on generated images.

We also include some generated outputs along with the captions used (in a txt file inside the respective folders). Also, added the datasets used for fine-tuning the model.

Two instances of training were performed:
- Training on Bajirao Mastani movie.
- Training on the custom Rajinikanth dataset provided.
